# Polacode

Note: The original project by [Pine](https://github.com/octref) & [Peng](https://github.com/rebornix) was abandoned, so I picked up it when it broke back in 2019.

Modifications include:
- Fixed when VS Code switched away from syntax-highlight-copy by default
- Improved performace from inlining multiple files
- Anton Palgunov added buttons for toggling transparency and shadow
- PR's are welcome!

Happy Coding!

## Why?

You have spent countless hours finding the perfect [JavaScript grammar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=javascript%20grammar&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance), matching it with a [sleek-looking VS Code theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Themes&sortBy=Downloads), trying out all the [best programming fonts](https://www.slant.co/topics/67/~best-programming-fonts).

You take three days porting over [your theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) before starting to use VS Code.
You shell out $200 for [italic cursive html attributes](https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator).

The code has to look right.

## Seriously, why not just take a screenshot?

- I like and care about the shadow, padding & rounded corner of macOS's screenshot. I want an easy way to have those nice visuals for any selection of my snippet.
- I want to hide errors, warnings, color decorators, folding markers, line numbers, scrollbar and minimap.
- It generates something decent on Windows & Linux.

## Tip

- When running out of horizontal space, try the command `View: Toggle Editor Group Vertical/Horizontal Layout`.
